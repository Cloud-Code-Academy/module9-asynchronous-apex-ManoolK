# Developer Kickstart Module: Asynchronous Apex

This repository is a cornerstone of the Developer Kickstart curriculum at Cloud Code Academy. Tailored for emerging Salesforce developers, this module dives into the powerful world of Asynchronous Apex, highlighting the diverse strategies and tools like Future methods, Batch Apex, Queueable Apex, and Scheduled jobs.

## Goals of the Practice

During this repository, you will enrich your understanding of:
- The essential nature of Asynchronous Apex in facilitating long-running operations without hogging system resources.
- Implementing Future methods to perform specific asynchronous actions, helping to evade governor limits.
- Crafting and managing Batch Apex jobs, allowing bulk processing of records in an optimized manner.
- Leveraging Queueable jobs to chain jobs sequentially, ensuring they run in a specific sequence.
- Setting up and managing Scheduled tasks, permitting the periodic execution of tasks based on specified intervals.
- Strategies to handle asynchronous exceptions and errors gracefully, ensuring data integrity and system robustness.

By conquering Asynchronous Apex techniques, you'll unlock the ability to develop highly scalable, efficient, and user-friendly applications in Salesforce. This prowess amplifies your proficiency in creating dynamic Salesforce solutions that can seamlessly manage large data volumes and extended processing times.
