/*
 * NextStepQueueable Class Description:
 * 
 * Implement the Queueable interface to process records asynchronously.
 * This example processes up to 10 accounts at a time.
 * It removes the Next Step from the accounts and related opportunities.
 *  
 * Benefits of using Queueable methods:
 * 
 * 1. Chaining Jobs: Allows for the chaining of jobs, meaning you can add another job to the queue from a running job.
 * 2. Stateful Execution: Supports stateful execution, which allows member variables to retain their values between job invocations.
 * 3. High Concurrency: Processes large sets of data without hitting governor limits.
 * 4. Flexibility: Useful for operations that need more flexibility in execution, especially when there's a possibility of chaining or performing related async operations.
 * 5. Enhanced Integration Capabilities: Useful for making asynchronous callouts to external systems, allowing for more extended processing times.
 * 
 * For more detailed information, refer to the official Salesforce documentation: https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_queueing_jobs.htm
 * 
 * Note: The class below contains placeholders for implementing a queueable job to update accounts and opportunities.
